# Cross-Device-Profiled-Attack
 
This repository contains Demos and data on how to reproduce the results presented in "Cross-Device Profiled Side-Channel Attack with Unsupervised Domain Adaptation."


Each dataset is composed of the following folders and script:

- ./Data: the dataset (.npy format) used in the experiments. 
- ./models: contains the pre-trained model, fine-tuned model, etc.
- ...\_CDPA\_Demo.ipynb: the notebook file that contains both codes and outputs. This notebook demonstrates how to load a dataset, how to pre-process the data, how to fine-tune a network, how to evaluate the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, etc.
